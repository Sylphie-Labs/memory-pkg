/**
 * migrations/index.ts -- Migration registry for memory-pkg.
 *
 * Each migration is a module that knows how to upgrade a consumer's repo
 * from one specific version to one specific next version. New migrations
 * register themselves here in chronological order.
 *
 * As of 0.1.0 (initial release) the registry is empty — there is nothing to
 * migrate from. The first real migration ships when 0.2.0 lands.
 *
 * Naming convention: `<from>-to-<to>.ts`, e.g. `0.1.0-to-0.2.0.ts`.
